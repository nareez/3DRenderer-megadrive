 * \brief User task support
 * \date 12/2021
 * \author doragasu
 *
 * This module allows assigning a function that will run as an user task.
 * CPU time is given to that function in several ways:
 * - When the supervisor task calls TSK_userYield(), the user task executes
 *   immediately until the next VBlank interrupt. Then supervisor task is
 *   resumed.
 * - When the supervisor task call TSK_superPend(), the user task executes
 *   immediately until one of the following happens:
 *   a) The user task calls TSK_superPend().
 *   b) The timeout specified in TSK_superPost() expires.
 *
 * For the scheduler to work, VBlank interrupts must be enabled.
 *
 * These functions are implemented in task.s
